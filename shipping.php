        <h2>Freight Shipping in Daytona Beach, FL with Packing Generals</h2>
        <p>Have something oversized, palletized, heavy, or simply too large for standard parcel services? We coordinate both Less-Than-Truckload (LTL) and full truckload freight, plus expedited air cargo options when timing matters.

        <p>We regularly assist with business-to-business equipment moves, bulk supply re-orders, fixture relocations, crates, trade show materials, and time-sensitive replenishments. If you aren’t sure how to classify or prepare your freight, we’ll walk you through packaging standards, NMFC code basics, and accessorial considerations (liftgate, inside delivery, residential surcharge, limited access, and more).</p>

        <h2>Custom Packages</h2>
        <p>Need something branded, sized just right, or structurally reinforced? We design and produce custom packaging solutions—from logo-labeled cartons to purpose-built inserts that cradle irregular or fragile items. Whether you're shipping prototypes, serial production runs, gifts, or presentation kits, we can tailor a packaging system that travels well and looks sharp on arrival.</p>
        <h3>What we can customize</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Corrugated carton sizing (single run or small batches)</li>
            <li>Custom internal void-fill and protective inserts</li>
            <li>Branded / labeled outer boxes (short-turn digital print)</li>
            <li>Cut-to-size foam and multi-layer cushioning</li>
            <li>Display or gift presentation kits</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Pricing is based on dimensions, material type, and complexity. Simple re-dimensioned cartons are often very affordable; multi-layer or multi-color branded kits require a project quote.</p>
        <p><strong>How to start:</strong> Email us basic dimensions (L × W × H), approximate weight, fragility concerns, and any artwork needs—or just reach out through our <a href="contact.php">Contact page</a> and we’ll follow up. Bring the item in if you prefer and we’ll measure and recommend materials on the spot.</p>
        <p><em>Turnaround:</em> Many custom-sized plain cartons can be ready quickly; branded or structural foam projects may require additional lead time.</p>
