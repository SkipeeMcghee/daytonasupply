        <h2>Account Rules</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account credentials and for all activity that occurs under your account. Notify us immediately of any unauthorized use.</li>
            <li>You represent and warrant that any payment method used is yours or that you are authorized to use it; you agree to pay all charges incurred by you or anyone using your account.</li>
            <li>We may suspend, restrict, or terminate accounts and refuse access to the site at our sole discretion for violations of these Terms, suspected fraud, or other conduct that may harm the site or others.</li>
        </ul>

    <h2>Orders & Pricing</h2>
    <p>All product listings are invitations to offer. After you place an order, we will provide an order acknowledgement. We may accept or reject your order in our sole discretion. Orders may be cancelled for reasons including pricing errors, stock unavailability, suspected fraud, or other operational reasons; if cancelled after payment, we will issue a refund in accordance with the Payments & Refunds section.</p>

    <h2>Payments & Refunds</h2>
    <p>Payments are processed by third-party payment processors. By providing payment information you authorize such processors to charge the applicable amount. Refunds are issued at our discretion and subject to verification; where refunds are due, we will use the original payment method unless otherwise agreed. We are not responsible for delays caused by payment processors or banks.</p>

    <h2>Shipping & Delivery</h2>
    <p>We arrange shipment through third-party carriers. Delivery dates quoted on the site are estimates only and are not guaranteed. Title and risk of loss pass to the customer upon delivery of the goods to the carrier unless otherwise expressly agreed in writing. We are not liable for carrier delays or loss/damage occurring in transit, although we will assist in filing claims with carriers where appropriate.</p>

    <h2>Returns & Cancellations</h2>
    <p>Return eligibility varies by product and will be stated in the product listing or order confirmation. To request a return or cancellation, contact customer support within the timeframe specified. Returned goods must be in their original condition unless otherwise agreed; customers are responsible for shipping costs for returns unless the return is due to our error or a defective product.</p>

    <h2>User Conduct</h2>
    <p>Users must not use the site for unlawful purposes, to infringe intellectual property, to attempt unauthorized access, or to transmit malicious code. Automated scraping, data harvesting, or other forms of unauthorized data collection are strictly prohibited. Violations may result in civil and criminal liability and we will cooperate with law enforcement as required.</p>

    <h2>Termination</h2>
    <p>We may suspend, restrict, or terminate access to the site and services at any time for any reason, including suspected fraud or a material breach of these Terms. Termination does not relieve you of obligations incurred prior to termination, including payment obligations.</p>

    <h2>Governing Law</h2>
