    <p>We share personal information with third-party service providers that perform services on our behalf, such as payment processing, email delivery, analytics, and shipping. Such providers are authorized to use your information only as necessary to provide these services. We may also disclose information to comply with legal obligations, to enforce our rights, to protect the safety of our users or the public, or in connection with a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets, in which case customer data may be transferred as part of that transaction.</p>

    <h2>Security</h2>
    <p>We implement administrative, technical, and physical safeguards reasonably designed to protect personal information from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. Despite these measures, no security control is infallible, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.</p>

    <h2>Data Retention</h2>
    <p>We retain personal information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Policy, to comply with legal and tax obligations, to resolve disputes, and to enforce our agreements. When personal data is no longer required, we will securely delete or anonymize it in accordance with our data retention policies.</p>
